In this project I'm using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) with Bat Algorithm to optimize features and to predict malicious code. From internet various software’s can be downloaded and this software may contains malicious code and upon execution of such software can cause file corruption or data loss. All existing technique may use static or dynamic technique to identify such malicious code but it’d detection rate is to less and to overcome from this problem author using two algorithms called BAT to optimize features which can resolve features imbalance problem and this optimize features will be passed to CNN algorithm to train CNN model and this trained model can e applied on new malicious code or test data to detect malware family. Propose algorithm is called as DRBA (dynamic resampling based on BAT Algorithm). Author comparing performance of propose DRBA with GLCM- SVM and GLCM-KNN and DRBA is giving better prediction accuracy.Extraction of image texture features are called as GLCM and author is using malware dataset to implement above algorithm and this dataset contains binary data and this binary data can be converted to gray colour images as both binary and image data contains values between 0-255. Generated images can be used to train DRBA CNN model. Image features can be optimize with the help of BAT algorithm.
